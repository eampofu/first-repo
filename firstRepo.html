    <p> Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
    <br> Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.
    <br> It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.
    <br> It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
